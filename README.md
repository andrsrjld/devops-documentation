## DEVOPS DOCUMENTATIONS

This repository is used to documentation for internal DevOps project. The reason for documenting these is so that others can take something from it and also hopefully enhance the resources. This will **not cover all things** "DevOps" but it will cover the areas that I feel will benefit my learning and understanding overall.
